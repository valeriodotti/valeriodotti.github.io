              I propose a new theoretical framework to investigate the effects of population ageing on immigration policies. Voters' attitude towards immigrants depends on how the net gains from immigration are divided up in the society by the fiscal policy. In the theoretical literature this aspect is treated as exogenous to the political process because of technical constraints. This generates inconsistent predictions about the policy outcome. I propose a new equilibrium concept for voting models to analyse the endogenous relationship between immigration and fiscal policies and solve this apparent inconsistency.
I show that the elderly and the poor have a common interest in limiting immigration and in increasing public spending. This exacerbates the effects of population ageing on public finances and results in a high tax burden on working age individuals and further worsens the age profile of the population. Moreover, I show that if the share of elderly population is sufficiently large, then a society is unambiguously harmed by the tightening in the immigration policy caused by the demographic change. Finally I show that the implications of the model are consistent with the patterns observed in UK attitudinal data and in line with the findings of the empirical literature about migration.

              I investigate the equilibrium properties of a deterministic voting model in which the policy space is multidimensional and politicians have limited ability to commit to platforms. This analysis is useful to answer Political Economy questions in which the multidimensional nature of the policy is crucial to model voters' trade-offs.  The use of unidimensional models to study such problems is prevalent in the literature. This usually implies that one or more policy dimensions are assumed to be exogenous. This choice delivers sharp theoretical predictions, but implies an oversimplification of the problem, which often results in implausible or empirically inconsistent predictions.
I show that under suitable restrictions on the individuals' capability of committing to policy platforms and on individual preferences a Median Voter Theorem holds even if the policy space is multidimensional. Moreover, I show that the comparative statics of the equilibrium policy outcome induced by a change in the voters' distribution is monotone. I use this tool to extend the Meltzer-Richard model about size of the government. I show this model delivers empirically consistent predictions if a sufficiently rich policy space is assumed. Finally, I show that this framework can be used to study other Political Economy problems beyond simple voting problems.

              I study the relationship between income inequality and public intervention in education in a voting model. Traditional Political Economy models typically imply a strong relationship between income inequality and public intervention in redistributive policies. Empirical evidence suggests that this may hold true only for certain kinds of policies, e.g.  cash transfers, but it may not hold true in the case of social security and education policies. I propose a method to study this relationship in the case in which forms of redistribution other than the public provision of education are available to voters. Moreover, I allow consumers to opt-out of the public education system and get private education. This assumption implies that individual preferences may exhibit non-convexities and therefore the equilibrium may not be unique. 
I show that the relationship between income inequality and governmental intervention implied in the traditional literature is mainly a result of excessively restrictive assumptions.  In particular, in a political equilibrium income inequality negatively affects public investment in education if the latter tends to reduce future inequality. This is consistent with the results in the empirical literature about public investment in education.
